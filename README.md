Deus Ex: The Fall Door/Safe Hacker
==================================

Sometimes it is more fun to write a clever hack for a videogame than it is to play it!

Not a huge fan of the latest Deus Ex game, but I had a blast writing my own bruteforcer for the doors and safes.

Simply open the in-game prompt for a four digit code, tab out, and run the script. When you return to the game the script will brute force the code needed to access the door or safe. 

Have a way to make it faster? I'd love to know! This dead simple script can hack it in under 2 minutes. 

### Important Note

- This script *absolutely must* be run as administrator for the keypresses to be sent.
